                <p>Stay with the situation , understand it properly and keep trying to overcome it. Running away and
                    trying
                    to come out as quickly as possible does not work with deep rooted mental suffering</p>

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>The process of inner transformation had begun, and deep down, in the core of my being, the river of  consciousness was silently giving birth to new tributaries which would eventually flow into the great ocean. The external inputs  required for accelerating the process were provided for in strange ways.               If I needed clarification regarding the practice of yoga or the finer points of philosophy and religion, books that discussed precisely the same questions, would fall into my hands as if by magic. As I grew older and was allowed to move around on my own, I began to frequent the Trivandrum Public Library, an old Victorian building which was a virtual treasure house of ancient works on philosophy, religion and even ceremonial magic.There was a long haired and bearded librarian whose name I don’t remember now, who appointed himself my mentor and, wonder of wonders, suggested the right book at the right time. In this way, I read The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, The Gospel of Ramakrishna, Isis Unveiled, The Secret Doctrine by Madame Blavatsky, The Zohar, The Upanishads and The Bhagavad Gita, the Greek philosophers Aristotle, Plato and many others.An excerpt from ‘Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master - A Yogi’s Autobiography’ by Sri M</p>
